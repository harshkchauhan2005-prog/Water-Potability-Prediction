# 💧 Water Potability Prediction using AI/ML

This project aims to **predict the potability of water** (safe for drinking or not) using **machine learning algorithms** on real-world water quality datasets.  
It was developed as part of the **AICTE–Edunet–Shell Skills4Future Internship (Green Skills & AI domain)**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Access to clean drinking water is a global challenge. By analyzing water quality parameters (such as pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity), this project predicts whether the water is **potable (1)** or **non-potable (0)**.

- **Domain:** Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning  
- **Tools & Languages:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
